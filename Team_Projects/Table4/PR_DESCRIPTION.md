# Team Table4: Challenge 4 - Women in Public Sector Jobs

## Challenge Overview
Assessing whether women's high public-sector employment reduces private-sector opportunities (crowding out) or expands them (crowding in).

## What's Included
- **Challenge Definition** (`project.md`): Detailed problem statement with two competing hypotheses
- **Data Acquisition** (`fetch_data.py`, `data_instructions.md`): Scripts and instructions for obtaining World Bank and ILO data
- **Initial Analysis** (`analyze_data.py`, `analysis.md`): Analysis of public sector employment share across countries
- **Visualization** (`results/public_sector_share_dist.png`): Distribution plot of public sector employment

## Key Findings (Preliminary)
- Top countries by public sector share: Maldives (47%), Russia (45%), Djibouti (43%)
- Most countries have 10-30% public sector employment share

## Next Steps
- Obtain Female Labor Force Participation data
- Correlate public sector share with private sector employment outcomes
- Test crowding out vs crowding in hypotheses
