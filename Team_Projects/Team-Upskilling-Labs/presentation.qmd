## The Problem

* By 2035, global labor markets will be radically different.  
* Youth supply (15–24) shifts dramatically across regions.  
* Skills, not just population, will decide who benefits from digital/AI jobs.

**Key Question:**

*Which youth skills will matter most in 2035 — and where will they be located?*

## Region Comparison: Skill Profiles

Chart: **Regional heatmap**  
Highlight:

* Asia \= huge mid/high skill base  
* Africa \= dual challenge (high low-skill \+ rising mid-skill)  
* LAC/ECA \= modern skill distribution  
* MENA \= rising mid-skill, lagging tertiary

## The Geography of Global Talent

Chart: **Regional share of skilled youth (2035)**  
Insight:

* Asia \= \~65% combined  
* Talent is geographically concentrated

## Gender Shifts: Women Rising

Chart: **Countries where young women \> men in post-secondary**

## Country Leaders & Risk Outliers

Two short lists:  
**Leaders (Tertiary):** CHN, USA, EGY, RUS, IDN, BRA, MEX  
**Outliers (No Education):** NGA, DZA, IRQ, AFG, ETH, etc.

Insight:

“Large populations ≠ large skilled populations.”

## So What? Policy Recommendations

1. **Scale post-secondary vocational/digital tracks** in Africa \+ South Asia  
2. **Invest in gender-equal talent pipelines** where women already lead  
3. **Target global talent hubs** — Asia dominates the 2035 supply

**“The future of jobs will be decided by where youth skills grow fastest — and our data shows exactly where that is.”**
